# Zebsite

A personal portfolio website showcasing photography, code projects, philosophy, and more. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Gallery:** Browse a curated selection of photographs and short films.
- **Code:** Explore C++ code samples and password generator logic, displayed with a dynamic typing effect.
- **Architecture:** Two subsections—Minka Design and Garage Concept—showcasing architectural projects.
- **Philosophy & Essays:** Read some of my more cultured work.

## Dynamic JavaScript Features

- **Animated Code Display:**
	- The `code-script.js` file uses a custom `DOMWriter` function to simulate typing code and text into the Code page columns, creating an engaging, animated effect.
	- Three main code/text blocks are dynamically printed: an anagram generator (C++), a password generator (C++), and an introduction.
- **Asynchronous Typing:**
	- The typing speed adapts as the text progresses, mimicking a real person typing.
- **DOM Manipulation:**
	- Text is written directly to specific elements in the DOM, including line breaks and spacing, for a realistic code editor feel.

## Hosting

This site is designed for static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).
