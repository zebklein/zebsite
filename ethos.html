            <h1>Preface</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;#WIP# The ethical question is possibly the most discussed and undoubtedly the most challenging question known to man. Humanity is left divided and rightfully dissatisfied regarding the issue. My life’s ambition is to ease this dissatisfaction, if not quell it entirely. Please don’t think I take the gravity of this endeavor lightly. Even if I live and die without achieving this seemingly untenable feat, is there anything else worth doing?</p>
            <h1>Free Will</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Philosophers are met with a terrifying adversary early on in the quest for ethical enlightenment. All meaningful definitions of ethics are destroyed if the agent in question is absolutely determined. In other words, if all my actions are entirely the result of environmental causes and not of Me, the thinking thing, then intention and action are as meaningless as the cause. To address this challenge, it will be insightful to imagine what a being with free will, we’ll call this a “free agent”, might look like if one could exist. What would be going on at a physical level that would constitute a free agent? This would be, put simply, an unmoved mover. This being would need to be capable of acting on the world independent of the world. Something from the metaphysical “outside” reaching in. 
                The important point here is that there is only one way to falsify the existence of such a being: one would have to demonstrate that all of an agent’s actions can be determined given the full set of initial conditions. Take an electron, for example. It may feel strange to claim that an electron has free will, but what determines the way an electron acts upon our world? Until we’re able to completely determine the cause of all effects, “random” is indistinguishable from “free”, and human beings are no exception.
                From here, we can lean on a version of Pascal’s Wager to give us our first ethical axiom and carry us safely to the next stage of this intellectual journey. In lieu of a proof that you, the cogito, are a completely determined being, you are morally obligated to pursue moral knowledge. The same argument can be applied when considering a proof that no “objective moral framework” exists, but more on that later.

            <h1>Definition</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Those with a grip on at least the broad strokes of a genuine philosophical investigation, which if you’ve made it this far I assume you possess, will understand that the direction of a conversation on ethics is entirely determined by the definition of the terms. Put simply, ethics are the set of principles an individual uses to determine what they ought to choose to do in a given scenario. It will be most useful to move away from the Socratic method of definition in favor of Wittgenstien’s definition by usage, as the latter will be more informative.
                Note first that the word ‘ought’ is used to describe a requirement to accomplish some predefined task in an “if-then” or “in order to” pattern. For example, if you don’t want to be late for school, then you ought to wake up early. Note that in this example, the ‘ought’ is absolutely determined by the ‘is’. Specifically, most are made aware of the truth of the aforementioned statement by some combination of experience and the word of a trusted authority. In more divine contexts, the former portion is often omitted for convenience. The theory of morals in popular religions begin implicitly with “in order to do right by God…”, “in order to go to Heaven…”, “in order to achieve Nirvana…”, etc.

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is this categorization that can survive the waves of the criticisms levied against the theory of the Divided Line, so long as they are not misunderstood.</p>
            <h1>Ought from Is</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;	In work from the likes of David Hume we arrive at what may perhaps be the most daunting and complex intellectual thicket on this journey. Before approaching the question “what ought I do?” we must first determine what it would look like to derive a true ethical principle. In other words,  To accomplish this, it is, of course, paramount to define ‘ought’.
