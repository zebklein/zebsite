            <h1>Preface</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The following is a brief amalgamation of concepts I have studied over the past several years. While it still requires refinement, I believe that this essay is the thin end of a very fat metaphysical wedge. This project is ultimately meant to serve as a prelude to a subsequent essay titled 'Ethica pro Omnibus'. It is as all acts are: ethical. Please enjoy.</p>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The Platonic anthology is inundated with challenging and complex ideas. With the Republic at its core, Plato’s collected works are a masterclass in philosophy and, ironically enough, poetry. However, there exist elements of the Republic that require context if they are to continue to be impactful on the contemporary philosophical landscape. It isn’t hard to forget that Socretes and his interlocutors were not privy to the rise of the modern natural science taught in school today. This disjunction becomes a common avenue for criticism of many elements of the Republic. The following is a revivification of one of philosophy’s oldest and most impactful theories: the divided line.</p>
            <h1>Divided Line</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The divided line is a fundamental component of Plato’s Republic and stands as his primary ontological position. The paradigm suggests that all of existence can be categorized into one of four kinds of being.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>illusions e.g. shadows, reflections, images, poems</li>
                <li>objects of sense perception e.g. tables, chairs</li>
                <li>mathematical entities e.g. circles, triangles, equations</li>
                <li>Forms; the essence of all objects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This list is often conceptualized as a hierarchy of being, from illusions being “least real” all the way to the most real Forms. Furthermore, each of these categories isomorphically reflect possible states of mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>illusions are to imagination as;</li>
                <li>objects are to belief as;</li>
                <li>mathematical entities are to thought as;</li>
                <li>Forms are to knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The Platonic Forms are the most abstract and encompassing of the aforementioned categories. According to Plato, there exist Forms in correspondence with all objects of sense perception. In other words, the reason office chairs, dining room chairs, and dollhouse chairs are all called ‘chairs’ is because each of these instantiations participate in the Form of the Chair. Similarly, rainbows, Bach’s Brandenburg concertos, and Cleopatra all participate in the form of the beautiful. Finally, it is important to note that the four categories can be logically separated into two distinct pairs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Apparent (sensual) World, consisting of both illusions and objects of sense perception.</li>
                <li>The Conceptual (intelligible) World, consisting of mathematical entities and Forms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is this categorization that can survive the waves of the criticisms levied against the theory of the Divided Line, so long as they are not misunderstood.</p>
            <h1>Parmenides and the Third Man</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;One of the first major criticisms of Plato’s Divided Line comes from Plato himself in a dialogue titled ‘Parmenides’. This middle-period dialogue features the “gray eminence” (Sugrue, 11) Parmenides, a renowned philosopher of his time, engaged with a young Socrates on the theory of Forms. The dialogue between the two results in sufficient damage to the theory, particularly by the third-man argument. In short, this argument exposes an infinite regress.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;“Parmenides generates the infinite regress as follows. Consider a plurality of large things, A, B, and C. By One-over-Many, there is a form of largeness (call it “L1”) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, and C are large. By Self-Predication, L1 is large. So there is now a new plurality of large things, A, B, C, and L1.” (Rickless, 4.3).<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The terms “One-over-Many” and “Self-Predication” refer to principles of the theory itself, which Parmenides then uses to expose the theory’s major flaw. The regress becomes apparent, as the same argument can be applied to the newly constructed set {A, B, C, L1} and a new form L2, ad infinitum. Those familiar with the work of Bertrand Russel on set theory will note that Russel faced challenges very similar to the Third Man argument.
            </p>
            <h1>Wittgenstien, Mind, and Body</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The work of Ludwig Wittgenstien has had a pronounced impact not only on ancient Greek ontology, but ontological and epistemological philosophy as a whole. While Wittgenstien’s observations dispel many aspects of the Divided Line, they simultaneously give other aspects new and profound meaning. Wittgenstien contends that language is intrinsically a social enterprise, and that it is not necessary for the definitions of words to be precise or logically complete. Revisiting the question of the various kinds of chair: what makes office chairs, dollhouse chairs, and, on occasion, stumps around a campfire, all chairs? Wittgenstein would argue: it's the fact that we call them chairs. The definitions of words, in his view, are allowed to change to account for context and scope. This pragmatic approach to language is in contradiction with Socretes’ demand for the strict, every-only definition we see in mathematics. The Forms, therefore, do not exist anywhere but in our heads.<br>
                Wittgenstiens theory of language along with modern science imply that the ‘illusions'  category in the divided line be subsumed under objects of sense perception. Where does that leave objects of sense perception and mathematical entities? While Wittgenstien himself never argued this, one might be inclined to claim that all objects of sense perception are, too, merely constructed in our mind, and don’t formally “exist” in the real world. That there is no real world at all, and that everything is internal to us. This may be the case, but as it turns out, isn’t actually saying much of anything. External objects of sense perception can be considered ‘external’ regardless because they are not ‘me’. The mere fact that we can distinguish objects from ourselves and other objects makes them different from us. This is also a way to address the mind-body problem, as it breaks down the apparent separation between the realm of the body (physical reality) and the realm of the mind (thought). So while these two realms exist as apparently separate, interaction between them is not illogical. In short, the realm consisting of objects of sense perception stands.<br>
                Mathematical entities stand apart in the following way: while it may have its root in the physical world, mathematics quickly transcends that realm. There is no way of representing the square root of -1, for example, in the physical world. Yet we know that 'the square root of -1 = the square root of -1' to be a true statement. Tautologies like these illuminate the necessity for an important distinction between conceptual and procedural knowledge and a more thoughtful definition of truth.<br>
                Procedural knowledge is based on memory of repetition. A child knows that they cannot walk through their bedroom doorway without first opening the door because any attempt to do so has been unsuccessful (and perhaps painful). This procedural knowledge is then abstracted to all kinds of doors. It's worth noting that this kind of knowledge is always “imperfect” meaning that cannot ever be guaranteed. It is indeed possible that, one day, it becomes possible to phase through a door. In contrast, as long as the presupposed mathematical axioms remain true, the pythagorean theorem will always be true of all right triangles. Using these terms, it can be said that science is the attempt to uncover the axioms of the physical world.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;These two categories of knowledge gesture back at the divided line, as Plato makes the same classification between apparent, or procedural, and conceptual. While further subdivision may be stretching the limit of our observational ability, the aforementioned distinction remains. Science has shown that it may be possible to describe all physical phenomena using a conceptual framework, which collapses the distinction between Plato’s realm of illusions and objects of sense perception. Wittgenstien shows that the Forms exist not in a realm of their own, but in our heads as a part of the conceptual realm alongside mathematics. What remains of the divided line is not to be understated, and ought to be the epicenter for ontological, epistemological, and ethical study to come.</p><br><br>
